This document should help point you at various useful bits of information.

Frontier Frontend Port
----------------------

This repository contains the port of NetSurf to the Frontier UI library. This
isn't intended to become a proper port or for any serious usage and I don't
intend for it to get in to the main project.
I've used it more as a great way to test my Frontier and libgeek libraries and
has already uncovered many many bugs and missing features so far.

That said, it may prove to be a useful way to run the NetSurf in SDL with
a basic UI!


Building NetSurf
----------------

Read the [Quick Start](docs/quick-start.md) document for instructions.


Creating a new port
-------------------

Look at the existing front ends for example implementations.
The framebuffer front end is simplest and most self-contained.
Also, you can [contact the developers](http://www.netsurf-browser.org/contact/)
for help.
