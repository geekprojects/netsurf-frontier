  Frontier Frontend Port
========================
   This repository contains the port of NetSurf to the Frontier UI library. This
   isn't intended to become a proper port or for any serious usage and I don't
   intend for it to get in to the main project.
   I've used it more as a great way to test my Frontier and libgeek libraries and
   has already uncovered many many bugs and missing features so far.

   That said, it may prove to be a useful way to run the NetSurf in SDL with
   a basic UI!


  Building NetSurf
==================
  
  Read the QUICK-START document in the Docs/ directory for instructions.


  Creating a new port
=====================

  Look at the existing front ends for example implementations.  The framebuffer
  front end is simplest and most self-contained.  Also, you can contact the
  developers for help:

  Check out the developer documentation sources listed below too.
